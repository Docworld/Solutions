# Solutions

This repository contains the content for the solutions section of the Perch documentation. We would love to see contributions from Perchers, passing on tips you have discovered from working with Perch.

## How to contribute

Anyone can contribute to the Solutions by [forking the repository](http://github.com/PerchCMS/Solutions) and making a pull request with your content. You can find information about how to do that on [Github](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

## Suggesting an edit to an existing solution

If you see an error in an existing solution or would like to add to it, you can do so by submitting a pull request. It may be that we suggest your changes would actually be better as a new solution - it is find if there is repetition as the idea of this section is to help answer the actual questions people have.

## Submitting a new solution

Each solution is a simple Markdown document. Below is a starter template for a new solution. The meta data at the top ensures that we know when the solution was created and who to credit, you can also suggest some tags.

Below that the question that the solution answers should be added as a level 1 heading, and immediately below a level 2 heading gives a short synopsis or the problem.

Then write up your solution.
