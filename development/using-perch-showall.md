# How do I see what is available in my template?

## During development, you want to know what is available from the template you are working with.

You can add a special [perch:showall](http://docs.grabaperch.com/docs/templates/show-all/) template tag to any template in Perch and it will show you all of the fields that are available for use.

    <perch:showall />

This can be especially helpful when working with a first party app that has static fields.
